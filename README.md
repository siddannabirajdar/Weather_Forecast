# Weather_Forecast
 A real-time data processing system to monitor weather conditions and provide summarized insights using rollups and aggregates. The system will utilize data from the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/)

This project fetches real-time weather data for major Indian metros like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, and Hyderabad, every 5 minutes (configurable). It processes and stores weather conditions, performs daily rollups, and provides insights like:
Average, Maximum, and Minimum Temperatures.
Dominant Weather Condition for the day.
User-configurable alerts based on threshold breaches (e.g., high temperatures).

Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
API: OpenWeatherMap API
Visualization Libraries: Chart.js (for visualizing trends and alerts)
